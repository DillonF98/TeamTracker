As Part of a 3rd year assignment we were assigned the task of creating an app using Android Studio and with the use of the Kotlin
language. For my app idea I decided to develop an app to which information and statistics are stored I chose to develop a team tracker 
app for Liverpool FC as I myself am a life long fan of the club. My reasoning behind this app idea is that I wanted to create something 
which I found to be of interest and something in which could be of good use to other fans of the club. The app is designed to cater for
not only the current standing of Liverpool FC but also the historic clubs triumps and legends which can be seen from the legends of the club
and trophies won since the clubs establishment in 1892.

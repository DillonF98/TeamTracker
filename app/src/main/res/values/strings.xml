    <string name="text_overview1">Since they were founded in 1892, the Liverpool Football Club name was synonymous with fame and glory.
        Internationally, Liverpool is the most successful British club of all time with plenty of European trophies on their record.
        They are one of the most popular football teams in the world, with over 200 supporter clubs in at least 50 different countries.
        Liverpool Football Club was formed following a disagreement between the Everton Football Committee, who oversaw the city of Liverpools
        oldest professional football club, and John Houlding, who owned Anfield, the land used for games.</string>

    <string name="text_overview2">Houlding originally wanted to name the team Everton Athletic to spite the former committee, but the English Football Association wouldnt allow it. So instead, the team adopted the moniker,
        Liverpoool F.C, The team quickly rose through the ranks of English Football, winning the Lancashire league, then the Second division, gaining entrance
        to the First Division, English Footballs highest league.  </string>

    <string name="text_overview3">They won it twice in the span of 5 years, 1901 and 1906. While the league did not have the
        competitive nature it does now, the accomplishment was no small feat. These crucial years would help establish Liverpool as a team to be respected, though
        far from the dominance they would enjoy later in their tenure.
